## Hello, Mapbox!

Thank you for this opportunity to present my skills to you; truly, it is my hope that they are up to your expectations.
Maps are very special objects to me: my exposure and near-obsession with them as a child helped me see the art and
craftsmanship in them so much that I have painted maps of some of my favorite neightborhoods freehand, in
acrylic. Also, I have become a sort of human GPS: a valuable asset to friends and family on trips.

If this goes well it will be my sincere pleasure to help write the documentation that assists others in using Mapbox's diverse
toolset to create the maps of tomorrow.
